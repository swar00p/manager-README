# manager-README
## What is this?
This artifact serves a few purposes:
* it introduces me to you
* it lets you understand the type of leader I am
* it lets you understand my working style and my expectations from you (my peers and my team members)
* it's a way for me to reflect on my leadership values and working styles and constantly improve on them

As such, I expect this to be a living document that changes as I change (hopefully for the better).

## Who am I?
I am a grizzled veteran in the world of informaton technology and software development. My first foray in the world of coding was during my undergraduate days when I wrote code in Fortran. Soon thereafter, I learned C using (what else?) K&R's famous book. I loved (and still love) programming in C and felt that it engaged my intellectual faculties. My primary role as a coder ended in the mid-2000s when I started taking on management and senior leadership roles.

I would like to believe that I am still fairly technical and hands-on. I can (and do) write code using Python and bash shell scripts for small tasks. I have contributed on more than one occasion to the Firefox for Android (Fennec) project. I have written a couple of Android apps for my own personal use and collaborated with my son to publish an Alexa skill.

Having said that, I get a lot of satisfaction from managing (nay leading) projects and large programs. My understanding of technology and processes as well as my ability to foster healthy relationships with key stakeholders put me in a unique position of being able to build and nurture successful teams. I am a strong believer in the value of early feedback and iterative development. It does not matter to me whether it happens under the umbrella of "Agile/Scrum" or "Waterfall" but involving key stakeholders and refining the implementation of a deliverable is aboslutely key to the success of any product or project.

To summarize, a few tidbits about me. I am:
- tech-savvy and business-aware
- laid back and impatient
- well-organized and flexible
- focused on strong collaboration within the team and between teams
- a servant-leader but I lead with decisiveness

## My job
I see my job as being able to balance a few conflicting needs:
* understand the needs of the business
* ensure that my team(s) understands and appreciates those business needs
* push back on the business when necessary
* push for results against challenging timelines when necessary
* protect and defend my team(s) at all times

To accomplish this, I have to do the following:
* staff and train my team to be able to deliver the best results in a timely manner
* communicate clearly and regularly

## My leadership principles & values
My leadership principles/values are in three categories:
### Technical
* automate, automate, automate!
* architect and build for:
    * performance
    * resilience
    * traceability
    * security
    * maintainability
### Process
* espouse quality as the #1 priority at all times
* establish a never-ending cyle of continuous improvement
* set aside time for paying off technical debt
* underpromise, overdeliver
### People
* empower each team member and encourage them to own their deliverables
* experiment and learn from failures and successes
* make work-life balance a priority; make room for fun!

## My working style
* Meetings
   * I like to start and end my meetings on time and I expect all attendees to be punctual
   * I like to provide an agenda for any meeting that I host...and I expect the same for any meeting that I'm invited to
   * More often than not, I send out recaps (I don't like to call them "minutes) of what we discussed in a meeting...and I expect the same from organizers of meetings that I'm invited to
* 1-on-1s
   * I prefer 1-on-1s with my team members to be once in 2 weeks
   * I want my team members to be in control of the agenda for each 1-on-1
   * 1-on-1 meetings should not focus on status updates. There are enough meetings to discuss project statuses.
* I like being involved in technical discussions. I may not be the most technically accomplished person in the room or meeting but I feel like I can always contribute value in one way or another
* I like to look at metrics and any other numerical data to form opinions and base my decisions on
